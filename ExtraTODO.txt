Reorder vim customizations based on

Things that should be available by default:

....


Things I customized:

...






Make <insert mode> behave like normal modern text editors?
    No. I have to resist this I guess. I should also resist putting cut, copy, paste to x,c,v

How about normal UNDO in insert mode? You undo everything you've written that's bonkers

Hmmmmm... New Idea. Actually it might be best if I leave these things "as vim as possible" for
a long while until I get a hold of them. Then, make it so it behaves like a normal text editor 
inside insert mode as well. And then let more long time pass. Then I'll know whether I'll prefer 
one mode or the other. Like what about ctrl+backspace... I always use that, I can't imagine it being
better on any vim config.
