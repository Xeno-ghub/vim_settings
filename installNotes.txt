How to install my vim config for Windows.

1. Ran Virtualbox + Ubuntu guest where I would run VIM.
2. Had a shared folder between my host & guest.
    2a. Setup shared clipboard in virtualbox ( vm settings -> General -> Adv -> Shared clipboard )

3. copy my vim stuff (use ~/.vim/vimrc, not ~/.vimrc to ensure plugins work) 

    # SETUP BASE VIM

    $> git clone https://github.com/Xeno-ghub/vim_settings.git
    $> mv vim_settings .vim

    # we don't want to use plugin managers if now it's native
    $> mkdir pack
    $> cd pack
    $> mkdir mypluginz
    $> cd mypluginz
    $> mkdir start

    ## # SETUP ADD-ONs

    # FZF

    $> git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim.git
    # copy confusingly named plugin...
    $> mv fzf.vim ~/.vim/pack/mypluginz/start

    # There's a second/first part to FZF...
    $> git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git
    $> cd fzf
    $> ./install
    $> cp -r fzf ~/.vim/pack/mypluginz/start/fzf

    # AG
    apt-get install silversearcher-ag

    # vim-lsp
    git clone https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp
    cp -r vim-lsp ~/.vim/pack/mypluginz/start/vim-lsp

    git clone https://github.com/prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim
    cp -r asyncomplete.vim ~/.vim/pack/mypluginz/start/asyncomplete.vim

    git clone https://github.com/prabirshrestha/asyncomplete-lsp.vim
    cp -r asyncomplete-lsp.vim ~/.vim/pack/mypluginz/start/asyncomplete-lsp.vim

    Put that crap in my vimrc (from minimal install)
    Put the rest of the crap from github

    git clone https://github.com/mattn/vim-lsp-settings
    cp -r vim-lsp-settings ~/.vim/pack/mypluginz/start/vim-lsp-settings

    hit :LspInstallServer in some source you want to use it

    
4. Modify .bashrc to allow bindable Ctrl-Q & Ctrl-S
    GOTO ~/.bashrc:q
    insert following lines:
# I wanna have access to CTRL+Q & CTRL+S so disable their innate functionality
stty stop ''
stty start ''
stty -ixon
stty -ixof


5. VIM Compatibility issues:
    [OPTIONAL]
    > Install xorg-xmodmap. (might already be installed under x11-xserver-utils)
        Need it to be able to remap <ESC> to <CAPSLOCK>
